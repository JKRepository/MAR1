FILEPATHING WORKS JUST KEEP EVERYTHING WHERE IT ALREADY IS AND DONT MOVE FILES FROM THE DOWNLOADS FOLDER
IM GONNA REPEAT THIS ONE MORE TIME:
DO NOT MOVE ANYTHING FROM THE DOWNLOAD DIRECTORY
otherwise pictures wont show.
Also, if there any text issues with the textfields, its an issue with the java swing library, so just maximize the window then
re-minimize it. Not only that, this works best with an HDMI attached, because the resolution issues magically dissapear.
Can't fix code I can't see, but I can play around it.
